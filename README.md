<h3>Proactive Handover in Multi-Cell Networks:
A Digital Twin Approach for Low-Complexity and Scalable
Performance</h3>

<p>I conducted research on designing a digital twin for multi-cell communication networks to facilitate proactive handover decision-making. The focus of this work was on developing solutions that achieve low run-time computational complexity, ensuring scalability and efficiency. I implemented the channel twin model using SIONNA and systematically evaluated the end-to-end performance of the proposed framework to validate its effectiveness.
